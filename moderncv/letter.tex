Dear Sir/Madam,\\[0.5cm]

I am writing to apply for the role of junior Ruby on Rails developer.
\\[0.5cm]

I am eager to work for a young company that is using current technologies
and methodologies.  Exvo's website and job posting descriptions give me the
impression that Exvo is such a company.\\[0.5cm]

Although my Ruby development experience is limited, it is my hope that you
will find that my experience and skills would be a welcome addition to your
company.\\[0.5cm]

I have over 2 years development experience with the MVC architectural pattern
using Apache's Struts framework, SQL, and Hibernate.\\[0.5cm]

My enjoyment of independent self-study motivated me to familiarize
myself with the basics of Ruby on Rails.  This same aspect of my personality
is what ultimately led me to pursue a Masters degree in pure mathematics.
\\[0.5cm]

Please see my attached resume for additional information on my work
experience.\\[0.5cm]

I can be reached by telephone at +1 780 2327870, or by email at
akydd@ualberta.net.  Thank you for your time.  I look forward to hearing
from you.\\[1.5cm]

Sincerely,\\[0.5cm]
Alan Kydd
