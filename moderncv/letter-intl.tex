Dear Sir/Madam,\\[0.5cm]

I am writing to apply for the role of junior software developer, which I found
posted on your website.
\\[0.5cm]

I have over 2 years of Java development experience.  This has provided
me with an excellent understanding of object-oriented programming,
and some understanding of design and architectural patterns.\\[0.5cm]

My previous roles at IBM were client facing.  I am comfortable communicating
with clients face-to-face, over the phone, or through email.
\\[0.5cm]

I have two math degrees, and have taken (and passed) courses such as
multivariate calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and numerical
analysis.  I also taught single variable calculus, abstract algebra, and real
analysis at the college level.\\[0.5cm]

Although I have no C++ development work experience, it is my hope that you
will find that my experience and skills would be a welcome addition to 3DI.\\[0.5cm]

Please see my attached resume for additional information on my work
experience.  I am not able provide links to samples of my software development
work, but I have attached my Master's thesis.\\[0.5cm]

I can be reached by telephone at +1 780 2327870, or by email at
akydd@ualberta.net.  Thank you for your time.  I look forward to hearing
from you.\\[1.5cm]

Sincerely,\\[0.5cm]
Alan Kydd
